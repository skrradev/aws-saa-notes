# GlobalAccelerator


| Feature          | Anycast IP                                 | Unicast IP                               |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Definition       | One-to-nearest addressing method           | One-to-one addressing method             |
| Routing          | Traffic is routed to the nearest node      | Traffic is routed to a specific endpoint |
| Redundancy       | High, due to multiple nodes                | Low, as it relies on a single node       |
| Load Distribution | Automatic, based on network proximity     | Manual, requires load balancing          |
| Scalability      | Highly scalable                            | Limited scalability                      |
| Use Cases        | Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), DNS      | Standard internet connectivity           |
| Efficiency       | High, reduces latency and improves speed   | Less efficient compared to Anycast       |
| Complexity       | More complex to set up and manage          | Simpler to set up and manage             |
